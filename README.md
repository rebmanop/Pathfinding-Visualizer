# Pathfinding-Visualizer
![This is an image](/assets/imgs/github_page_image.png)
# Description
Visualization of this kind helps to understand a general idea behind every implemented algorithm.
The application is written mainly for educational purposes, to learn more about pathfinding, maze generation and to challenge my software development skills.


#### Implemented pathfinding algorithms:
- A*
- Dijkstra's
- Depth-first search
- Breadth-first search
- Greedy best-first search
- Bidirectional breadth-first search

#### Implemented maze generation algorithms:
- Recursive division
- Randomized depth-first search (backtracker)
- Spiral 
- Simple stair pattern

#### Implemented features:
- Adjustable animation speed
- Draggable route points
- Real time revisualization
- Intermediate route point (parcel)
- Manual creation and removal of walls

All or some of the lists are likely to be updated at some point in the future.

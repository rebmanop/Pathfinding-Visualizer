# Pathfinding-Visualizer
![This is an image](/assets/imgs/github_page_image.png)
# Description
The application is written in python using **pygame** mainly for educational purposes, to learn more about pathfinding and maze generation.   

#### Implemented pathfinding algorithms:
- A*
- Dijkstra's
- Depth-first search
- Breadth-first search
- Greedy best-first search
- Bidirectional breadth-first search

#### Implemented maze generation algorithms:
- Recursive division
- Randomized depth-first search (backtracking)
- Spiral 
- Simple stair pattern

#### Implemented features:
- Adjustable animation speed
- Draggable route points
- Real time revisualization
- Intermidiate route point (parcel)
- Manual wall placement

All the lists will probably be extended at some point in the future.
